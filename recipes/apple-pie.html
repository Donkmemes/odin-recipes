    <h3>Home Baked Apple-Pie Recipe</h3>
    <p>
        This recipe was inspired by my mothers apple-pie, which was a hit when I was growing up. I'm very excited to get to share it with the world,
        as I believe there's nothing better than a good apple-pie.

    <h3>Ingredients List</h3>
    <h4>Crust</h4>

        <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 425F. Place 1 pie crust in ungreased 9-inch glass pie plate. Press firmly against side and bottom.</li>
        <li>In large bowl, gently mix filling ingredients; spoon into crust-lined pie plate. Top with second crust. Wrap excess top crust under bottom crust edge, pressing edges together to seal; flute. Cut slits or shapes in several places in top crust.</li>
        <li>Bake 40 to 45 minutes or until apples are tender and crust is golden brown. Cover edge of crust with 2- to 3-inch wide strips of foil after first 15 to 20 minutes of baking to prevent excessive browning. Cool on cooling rack at least 2 hours before serving.</li>
